*$ pip install -r requirements.txt*  

2. Input parameters such as number of folds(k) for CV, can be changed in the *params.py*.

3. To run the binary classification project from the *src* directory:   
*$ python binary_classification.py*

4. To run the project from the jupyter notebook, execute following command in the *code cell*:   
*import binary_classification*  

Outputs of the project in jupyter notebook is available in the *classification.ipynb*.   
While running in the notebook, uncomment the first two lines in *analysis.py* for importing IPython, if necessary.
